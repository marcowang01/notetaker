    Think of it as everything that affects consumption. That's not inherent, right? So in terms of the economy as a whole, that could be government expenditures, that could be some fixed investment that firms want to invest. Anything that's not directly related to disposable income. All right. OK. So these are planned expenditures? So we are calling this aggregate expenditures, but I want you to view this as one of expenditures. It is as a function of income, the amount of expenditures that the economy wishes to spend. Hey. All right. Now according to this model. Um firms are going to supply whatever people wish to demand. OK, So what does that mean? Here is what firms are willing to supply itself, right? This is what firms supply output. OK, great. Now where does this output go? This helped put is either going to go to whatever people wish to consume. Which is aggregate expenditures. Or what? So. Suppose that people do not wish to consume as much output as firms are producing. What happens to that output? Exactly. Firms put it in the inventories, correct? Now suppose that people want to consume more than what firms are currently producing. What happens to inventory? It decreases right? Because that's the only source from which output can come, and so according to this model. Output is going to be equal to planned expenditures. Was the change in inventories? OK. OK, you may ask. Well, this is kind of stupid because we are economists and if there is more, if people are trying to demand more than what is currently supplied, then prices should go. Up, but they cannot in the Keynesian model because the assumption is that prices are completely fixed. OK, much more about this in. Lectures to come. OK, so if prices cannot adjust, quantities need to adjust. OK, now what is an equilibrium in this model? An equilibrium in this model occurs when firms are willing to sorry occurs when X given level of output people. Want to spend exactly how much is produced? That is, there is no need to draw from inventories, so the equilibrium occurs when the change in inventories is equal to 0. That is when. Actual output is equal to planned output or planned expenditures. And so here. This means that um. 200 was 0.6. Why is equal to Y right? Aggregate expenditures are equal to output. And so if you solve this for Y this is going to be equal to 500. Any questions about this? OK. Now part number two of this question. Number Two asks. What is the change in inventories when income is equal to 700? Hey. OK, so from this equation here, the change in inventories add 700. Is equal to. Output which is 700. Minus. Whatever people want to consume at a disposable income of 700. Yes, makes sense. OK. So this is 700 -, 200. Minus 0.6 * 700. And if you bought this into the calculator, this is gonna be a 80. Hey. He just just be careful not to put here 500. Write 500 is the equilibrium, but I do not want to know what happens at the equilibrium. I want to know what happens at 700. And so if output is above the equilibrium level then. People demand less than what it's produced and inventories grow. All right, questions about this one. OK 4. Do you guys have the excitement in front of you, by the way? OK 4. Four is about the efficiency wage. I'm happy to go over that model, but. There's a simple formula for it. Which I never know by heart, so I have to drive the entire thing anyways, but I'm just going to give you the formula now. OK, SO4. Tells us that in an economy. Suppose that the this utility from work. Is equal to 50. Uh, the benefit from working. Sorry from not working. Is equal to 30, so the benefits from not working is commonly known as unemployment benefit. Right. And other stuff like home production and blah blah blah but. Mostly the unemployment benefit. So we are looking at A at a a worker that can search and be lazy and just be employed and not to any effort at all. OK, and we know that the probability of being. Thought. When serving is equal to 0.2. And we furthermore know well, we don't know anything more yet. We are supposed to consider two scenarios, one scenario with an unemployment rate of 10% and another scenario with an unemployment rate of 4%. OK. So. What is the efficiency wage? The efficiency wage is equal to the this utility. Right. Divided by. The probability of being caught. Times the unemployment, pin the times the employment rate. Sorry was the benefit. This is the disutility of working. This is a benefit of not working. This is the general formula, right? OK. So now we are supposed to consider two scenarios, one with an unemployment rate of 10% and one. With an unemployment rate of 4%. And how do we efficiency wages change? Well, the efficiency wage at 10% is going to be equal to. 15 / 0.2 times the unemployment rate which is 0.1 plus the benefit from not working which is 13. And this is going to be equal to. 100. And 13. And uh. The efficiency wage at 4%, we just have to replace. 0.140.04 plus 30 and this is going to be 62. 100 and. 8. Hey. And so what's the idea here? The idea here is that when the unemployment rate is low. Workers if they're fired. Have a higher probability of finding a job. Right. And so they will have an additional incentive for doing nothing. Right. And so the firms need to provide higher wages in order to induce the workers to work. Makes sense? Alright. Now what is next? OK, next is something that is sometimes a source of confusion. Which is 5. Which tells us a bunch of growth rates per capita of stuff per capita, and we are supposed to derive the growth rates of the solar residual or productivity from that. And so we know what we are told in that thing is that the growth rate of. Output per capita. Is equal to 4%. We are also told that the growth rate of capital per capita is equal to 5%. And we are also told that the share. Compensation. Of capital. Is equal to. 0.25. OK. OK, now this. Under the assumptions of perfect competition. Plus, talk about Bless. This is equal to alpha. And and I I hope that when. Alpha is a K to the power of alpha. Sorry. Production is equal to a * K to the power of alpha, N to the power of 1 minus alpha. OK, so this is whatever exponent is on. OK. All right. OK, so how do you compute alpha if you have? The total compensation going to capital and you have total output, you just divide 1 by the other. OK. Is this clear? Yes. OK. Yes, I can. So alpha. OK, so suppose that. Uh, let's see. Let me find. Well, whatever. Suppose that. Compensation of capital. In an economy. Is 200. OK, suppose. Total output. Is 500. And then you would find alpha. By dividing this by this, this is total compensation. Of capital. Divided by total. OK, and so this is 200 / 500 in the example that I gave you, which would be 2 / 5. Hey. By the way, just because sometimes it shows up in exams. What is the total compensation of Labor? In this example 1 -, 1 minus. Exactly. So it's 1 minus alpha. So this means that it is in absolute terms. Oh, that's. Uh, yeah. But in absolute terms, like in dollars, it's 300, right? All to say that if the exam said suppose that total labor compensation IS300, how much is alpha? You would have to do 500 -, 300 / 500. OK. Now as we have seen, if it wasn't last class, it was two weeks ago. From this. Using the rules of the exponents, we can get that the growth rate of output is equal to the growth rate of this of the solar residual was alpha times the growth rate of Capital plus one minus alpha the growth rate of Labor. Right. OK, now this would be very well, but we know alpha that we know, but we know the growth rate of total output. It's what, 4%? Now that's the growth rate of output per capita, not total output. So we're going to have to do some magic here. And so I'm going to rewrite this. Here I have GN minus alpha GN. Do you agree? OK, so I'm going to put this once again to the other side. And I get G 8 -, G Y minus GPA. This is equal to GA plus alpha times GK. Minus alpha GN. Now. The difference of the growth rates is the growth rates of the. Not the difference. There. Ratio racial exactly, so GY minus GN is equal to G of Y / N. Which we know. Similarly. GK minus GN is equal to G of K / n. Which we also know. And we know alpha. So we know everything we need to know. OK. And so here we just had to substitute the numbers. Uh, to get that 4% is equal to whatever we are trying to find out. Was 0.25 times. Alright, bye. How much is it? 5%? And so GA in this example is going to be 2.65 which is 996. Well. Actually doesn't. OK. Alright, are we good with this one? OK. So what I have left. Is uh? Just a little bit of conversation on the solo model. And then? We are done from my end. So I'm going to jump to number 13. I'm not going to solve #13 because we have basically solved #13 two weeks ago, right? Except. Have it on the table with the many periods in the Solo model. OK, the only thing I am going to say is. When I solved that problem, I simplified by assuming that there is no population grow. Right. That was the case two weeks ago. OK. In that table, the professor also simplifies and says that the growth rates of flavor is 0. But if he didn't, this is how you do it. So if he didn't, here is everything in the steady state is gonna be in per capita terms. OK. So when there is population growth? What's going to be fixed in the long run is capital per capita. OK. OK, so. What are going to be the equations of the model? We are going to have that output Per capita, this is little Y. Is going to be some a times little K which is capital per capita to the power of Alpha. This is what we had seen before, right? So nothing new here. Um. Consumption per capita was Investment per capita is going to be output per capita also. Nothing new here. Investments per capita is going to be equal to the savings rate times output per capita same. But. One thing changes, which is the law of motion. Capital per capita in the following period is going to be equal to. Whatever capital I have this period. Was whatever I invest. 8 minus depreciation. What's depreciation now? When I am talking in per capita terms. Not only the capital depreciate because of the usual wear and hair. But also to keep the same level of capital per capita when workers are increasing. I have to provide even more capital. Right. So. The effect is depreciation is going to be Delta Plaza. And the effective depreciation rate? OK, so this is the law of motion when we have population growth. OK. Does this make sense? OK, let me give you an example of why this is the case. Suppose that I have three computers. And three workers. This is in year one. And suppose that at the end of this year. One computer. One computer is ruined. That's the usual delta, the wear and tear. Right, so that would give me two computers, but suppose that I get four workers in year 2. OK, in order to keep aggregate capital constant, how many computers do I need to buy? Just one, right? Aggregate capital. But if I want to keep. Capital per capita constant, How many of them do I need to buy? Two, right. So I need to buy? 2. Of computers. And not just one. One from. Where? And tear. And in order to get four computers. Assuming. Valtek KT is equal to 1. OK. Does this make sense? OK, so this is pretty much all I wanted to say about that table. That table still has north equals to 0. So this conversation may seem kind of irrelevant, but and might someday not be equal to zero, and in that case you need to know how to use this equation here. OK. OK. All right, finally. Number 17. OK, and #17 asks us to show in the convergence graph. Whether all countries, Whether the Solo model predicts that all countries end up with the same level of capital. Right. And the answer is. Suppose that two countries start with the same level of capital, though they end with the same level of capital. I hear no. I hear yes. The usual answer for an economist is it depends. And it depends on the parameters of that economy, right? So if two economies are exactly the same in their savings rates, in their depreciation rates, and. In their population growth rates then yes. If not, then no, and we are going to see now exactly in which direction does the now go. Alright, so let's recall the. Solo graph. Here we have the depreciation line. Right, and because I am now considering population growth depreciation, the depreciation line is not only delta K, but instead it is delta plus N * K. Where K is output per cat. Sorry Captain. OK, now this is investment. Which is s * y T. And output is proportional expansion. This is investment in this. Pump it. Hey. OK. So three questions now. What happens? When the savings rate of an economy goes up. What happens to uh? So where is the steady state level of capital? By the way, right now. It's at the intersection right, of depreciation and investment, and so this is KSS and This is why S. Right. OK, great now. What happens if the savings rate goes up? If the savings rate goes up. Which one of those wines changes? Voicemail. The investment exactly, and it is the only one that changes. And so any changes in which direction, up or down? Up right. And so we will have, sorry, I don't have any other crawler. And so we will go somewhere here, right, which means that the steady state level of capital would now grow. Right. And assess prime and since capital would grow. Um. Outputs without so girl. Right. And so this says that if the savings rate countries with high savings rate will tend to have. Long drawn levels of output per capita that are also higher. Right. OK. Bonus question, does this imply that countries with higher savings rate also have higher, longer levels of consumption per capita? I see nose. Does anyone want to say why not? I guess if you have less, if you have lower saving or if you have higher savings rate then that kind of. Necessitates that consumption would be lower because ankle is divided up into. Right. Correct. But also if you have a variable settings, rate investment is also lower and so output is low and so consumption would also tend to be more. All to say that. There is a savings rate that maximizes consumption long run consumption, and that savings rate is called the Golden rule. Savings rates, right? So. This is kind of always wrong, right? Or well, not always. If the savings rate is below the golden rule savings rate. Increasing it will increase consumption. If it is above increasing it will decrease consumption. So it all depends on its relationship to the golden. Hank. So maybe this is easier in a graph. Savings right through golden rule. This is consumption per capita in the long run. This is something like this. This was great. And longer in consumption looks something like this. If you start with the savings rate, if you increase it in this direction, you increase long run consumption. But if you start with this savings rate, if you increase it in this direction, you decrease one point conception. OK. OK. Second question. Higher delta or higher N? Which one of these lines has? Is it gonna change? Just the depreciation, right. And so if we have a higher delta or a higher N, the slope of this line goes up, right? And so we get something like this. Again, I apologize for not having more callers. Right. And so the new level, steady state level of capital is going to be here. And so the new statistical output is going to be here. And so this means that when delta is high or north is high, then output per capita in the long run is going to be low. And so if I consider a type A economy. Who has? A. High savings rates and a low depreciation rate and population growth rate and type B economy. That is the opposite. Then. If I plot output per capita overtime. The Type A economy is going to have a high, steady state level of output. Per capita. Right. The type economy is gonna have a relatively lower. Steady state level of output per capita. Right. And so even if they both start with the same. Initial output per capita. They are going to converge to different things. Right economy is going to converge. Here whereas economy V is going to converge here. And this is. It. But I wanted to talk about today. Do you guys have any questions? No. No, I guess not specifically about like, you know, like content, but for like exams. You know what? I mean, I like, I've seen the practice exams, but do you know what types of questions he likes to pull from, like readings and stuff? I I think that the best examples you have are the ones in the practice exams. I mean, I apologise readings. I really cannot. Yes, anything. But yeah, you should be familiar with those as well because they are quizzed extensively as you have seen it. OK. Alrighty then, I will see you tomorrow, I guess. I think I'll be processing. And there is no quiz today, of course. Yeah, send you the output so far. I mean I did it the most successful one. It's like. Oh, I also prototyped a shelf. I'm gonna try tonight, and if it works out, great. Oh, also Lucas and I are gonna laser cut. For what? For the coffee table light. Oh, she's been running.

  Said. What's the dispersion relation of a photon? It sounds like. Non. Is it a non sequitur? Let's talk. In some sense, I can't explain why these two are the same. You know, they just happened to follow. From Maxwell's equal. OK, and then that sense it's like the thing I don't approve of the state and you calculate if it follows the equations it follows from Maxwell's equations. What are you supposed to do? But you know, that's. In spite of everything I say about oh, whether you feel something is irrelevant and the logic is just verbalization of what you know, which of course doesn't apply to what you don't know. And I always tell them classes. That story about if you were at lived in the 12th century and people said the world is round, you'd say no, no, no. Logic tells me the world is flat. It's. Logic never gets you anywhere. You have to do experiments now to check which logic is right and which logic is wrong, which may not think that's so easy in the 12th century for the world. But anyway, the question is, I can make it sound more logical by doing a little calculation. And the calculation I'm going to do is to take this and say, OK, there's the electric and magnetic field that could be constant things, OK, that goes in the. Half epsilon 0 E squared and 1 / 2 MU 0 * V ^2 terms. They could be oscillating and they could be constant. That's there's a volume term, but there's for the energy. But there's an energy flow term which is S and suppose S is this way. Let's imagine this. With. Surface area one, and let's imagine, you know, we talked about S off and on. We talked about the pointing vector. There was this particular problem. So the pointing vector was going round and round madly, even though the electric fields and magnetic fields were constant. We're talking about the magnetic. Pointing vector going in some direction. OK, and I'll make one posture. Or make a postulate that the speed at which S moves is the speed of. In many cases, like the cases, we'll talk about, but that's not necessarily general. We'll also find out cases where that's not true, but for now let's assume that. There's a moving part of the energy, and that's moving at the speed of light. So I'm going to take a cylinder with length C and say every bit of energy that starts here ends up here after one second. So what's the volume density of this energy that has? Vector S which says how fast it's moving. The moving part, OK, If you're thinking of water, you know, nobody studies hydrodynamics anymore, but. Didn't have. Amazing things. You know, it's also solving differential equations. That's what we're doing in B&M of course. But in hydrodynamics also you solve differential equations with various assumptions. But anyway, the differential equations are given as this, and I'm saying there's a flowing part of the energy, and we know that this gives you. The energy flowing past the unit area in one second. So now I'm saying you take that moving energy is like a moving train and say how much energy per unit volume. Help me please. Totally unable. Why did I draw that little cylinder? For fun. Think of it as like water flowing water flow. Velocity is V. And you're standing at some point and watching the river flow. The regular magically has a cross section of 1. Water flows past you in a second. Difference between the water and this thing is that the pointing vector tells you how much energy is going past this. One area you have one per second. OK. But it's also moving at the speed. C&M in water, OK, have momentum and energy are carried by particles, and if they're moving at a speed V that's what gives you the momentum, that's what gives you the energy here. The energy is a mysterious quantity that is carried along by some kind of disturbance in the electric field. Sometime defendants, but the energy can be us. This is as per unit area, per unit time crossing. Any area you draw that's normal to S, and if it's not normal to us, you have to do an S dot N But here the north, sorry N SM are in the same direction. So my question is. Once the energy density energy per unit volume in this box. Pisces. From the area, so oh, this area. It's not the radius, that's one area and energy density. So it's just that, so yes. No, you got it right. Except. It's not the radius, let's say it's, it's the area itself. Right. Because this energy, whatever passes through here in one second, flowing through, is everything that's here. After one second, it's all gone. So that area, yes, is that's the, that's the energy by itself. What do you need to integrate that over the area of S is the energy per unit, area per unit. Flowing past the area. OK, of course if you have. If I had some volume I'd have to integrate, but I've made this simple so I don't have to do all that stuff. Said yes is normal to the area. This area is 1, so we don't have to do area as times one. OK, that's all. So normally of course you have some some area and you have to do an integral up as. Like we made it. The momentum density is G equals S over C ^2. So if I calculate the energy per volume. Doing algebra. This over the details away. This is the kind of thing I always ask you to do in your head, but my question comes back. What's the dispersion relation of a photo? Anybody here not taken quantum mechanics? Not. You have not taken quantum mechanics. OK, yes, by quantum mechanics I didn't mean 239. I met 339-1. Let me back up. The rest of you have taken point mechanics, right? Tell me. Rather than what's the fundamental equation or equations are? And even then 239 there may have discussed it, but I won't push you guys on that. But those of you who have taken 339 tell me what are the fundamental equations or equations of quantum mechanics And it's quite possible that if you speak up, I'll say, ha fooled you. Yes. Fell into my child. Charging equation, that's. OK, and now classes but blah blah blah but short on your equation. But what makes it a detail is that it assumes that that the energy is P ^2 / 2 M plus B. That's my general at all. That's true of non relativistic particles that have mass. OK, but the energy momentum relation equals P ^2 + 3, which even in 239 you have discussed. I'm just not going to challenge you on it. Is a specific case, and today we're going to do the specific case of take Maxwell's equations, which I didn't write yet, and say rho equals zero, J = 0, and then we'll get all kinds of pretty results. But you have to remember it's a specific case. There are two equations that are completely general in quantum mechanics. 2 matching equations. Anybody with that? With that product, tell me what the two equations are. They're very similar. They say. To do that in 239. Those are completely general. As long as the Einstein did broadly equations. OK. And they're they're weird as all hell, because on the left you have two particle properties and their GM momentum on the right. There. What kind of properties? Wait there. Wait. Properties. OK, sorry I I have to wait for somebody to say something so I know you're not staring blankly at me. OK, frequency wavelength 1 / 2π or wavelength has related to particle. These are general, they don't depend on what the energy momentum relation. With this product. Tell me what the energy momentum relation is for a full. Tell me how you got. Yeah, yeah. Wait, wait, wait. I'm trying to explain this result by connecting it to something else. You know, I'm saying, you know, logic doesn't prove anything. But at least I can make this seem reasonable by connecting it to something you know. So I don't want you to use this result I'm saying. Pause. You could do that. You could do that. That's a good answer. OK. And I will get there, but I'll say that. Know that for a photon specific case, sometimes I'll call it a homework problem. And what I mean by a homework problem is a specific case. Homework problem. Always imagine this and imagine that and now apply it. OK, anytime we take a specific case like a photon or we take Maxwell's equations, we grow equals zero and J = 0, we're doing homework. There may not be reasonable homework problem, but it's code for specific case. 4 or photon. How was the Mega related to cake? You guys should know that, but I can see I'm going to have to discuss ways. Right. How do we know this? What's an egg in terms of frequencies 3 Pi over? At least I'm getting some nods now. OK, Omega is simply we didn't notation we use and physics is just one over F and that's a 2π. OK, F goes up, Omega goes down, and so forth. OK, is 2π over Lambda? OK, so this is the definition of Omega. The definition of. OK. Would I do this right? Because. I got those up. F goes up as well. OK so when I cross multiply I can't believe I'm doing this. OK. It says that C, which means they're going up and down the million times a second. Each time you're going 1 centimeter or something. So that's the speed. Is the Omega. Okay notation. Not, I mean if you took quantum mechanics, those of you who didn't raise your hand when I said did you take, did you not take one in the quantum mechanics you spend? Hours with Omega and K. But maybe there's no other context in which you discuss and maybe. Help me out. There it is, yeah. 239 of course, which is also the nuts, maybe quantum mechanics, but it uses the same mutation, so everybody's taken either 239 or 239 and 339, so I don't have to discuss it. OK. So what's the? Relation between Omega and I said between EP for photon. Given the fundamental relations of quantum mechanics, it's just equals PC. Which is what we have. OK. He added something else. He said, OK, we know from relativity, which you're not. I'm not going to say everybody. You have to know relative that you of course you don't. But even without knowing relativity, you may know. And if you don't, that's OK. A photon has no mass. Employment. So what I'm doing is what I said I would do at the beginning of the class is not proven anything, but maybe make you more comfortable with this S appearing both in the energy flow, the energy back, the flow vector, the pointing vector, energy per unit area per unit time, and with this constant. And the momentum density. War. Things like light which move with the speed of light is the same thing. It's the same thing. The energy is related to the momentum by this factor of C that comes from here or it comes from here. OK, that's the connection, so that's why. EDM has to. Has to have these two things happen. Same cross B term. I mean, none of this proves that the East Cross B term is there. That comes from the differential equations we've been working with. But the fact that the Save me Crosby appears here and here. Is it is from quantum mechanics or relativity or whatever you prefer. It's the same thing. So I just connected it to something else that. May have. OK, let's do. 0 epsilon 0. We've done this before at one class, I said. Let's, let's look forward to. Waves a little bit and we combine these equations. I can do it again, but. Maybe I don't have to. You take one equation, you. Dell cross that. OK for example, so I've now I've written this with Jay and row equal to zero. So we're doing a homework problem. OK, so you take Dell cross this one, you take this and you do a del cross, del cross E equals minus. Cross. This and there and we could do algebra. We've done before and it's in the book and Chapter 9 and you end up with. Remember, this is just. Minus.
